## Description

* NSObjectCoder is an efficient and delightful library for IOS and Mac OS X. 

* It automatically encodes and decodes all attributes of a NSObject instance.

* Choose NSObjectCoder for your project, you will be happy you don't need to write additional code for each 
  attribute anymore: 

    - (void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder;
    
    - (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder*)aDecoder;

## Version 

Version 1.0


## How-to use

1. Download [NSObjectCoder](https://github.com/Eric-LeiYang/NSObjectCoder.git) and drag "NSObjectCoder" folder directly to your project.

2. For any class extending NSObject that you would like to encode and decode, 

Import "NSObjectCoder.h" into .h file:

-> #import "NSObjectCoder.h"

3. Copy and paste the following code into .m file:

- (void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder{
    [NSObjectCoder encodePropertiesOfObject:self ToCoder:aCoder];
}

-(id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder{
    if(self = [super init]){
        [NSObjectCoder decodePropertiesOfObject:self FromCoder:aDecoder];
    }
    return self;
}

4. Enjoy now!
